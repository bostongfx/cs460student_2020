Ideas:
- Make artwork so that users can insert objects (maybe people or trees or other stuff)
    - ^ partially done, but now you need to draw these little objects
- Set up a controller/dat gui

--> Shift + Click on the ground to add plants and people (ensure that it only intersects the ground and not other objects)
--> Shift + Click on a structure to learn more

Questions/Issues:

- The planes I use to load the images: 
    0. when I zoom in/out or move the scene to certain positions, it seems like the "transparent" function of the plane temporarily turns off
        so it blocks off some neighboring planes/images. just a glitch maybe?
    1. I need to manually set the dimensions. Is there a way the dimensions can be automatically calculated from the image itself?
		- Just checked the actualy dimensions of the image and used those instead of guessing what a good dimension would be.
    2. The transparent parts of the image on the plane just show the background image of the scene instead of
        showing the other planes/objects behind it. Is there a way to make the other objects/planes visible through 
        the empty parts of another plane?

        Tried to convert the image into a glb file using 3D paint and then loaded it using the following link but I couldn't
        see the object on the scene. Maybe has to do with the colors again
